# flixMe-client

# Objective

Welcome to **flixMe** app! The main purpose will be using React to build the client-side for an application called flixMe based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

# What will it do?
The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.

This responsive web app with routing will use a single-page, rich interactions, several interface views, and a polished user experience. The client-side developed in this project will support the existing server-side from a previous one by facilitating user requests and rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.
